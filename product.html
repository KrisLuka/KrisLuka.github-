        <span class="subsubtitle">The start of the Apple Watch</span>
        The Apple Watch started being designed in Apple's headquarters in California, where after enough working prototypes the Apple Watch Series X was released, this was, in other words, a public prototype of the Apple Watch.
        A fun fact about the Apple Watch: They named it the Apple Watch instead of the IWatch because the name IWatch was already trademarked, as companies started trying to trademark names that apple would want to use in their standard I (followed by the product name) template, just so these companies could earn money by sueing Apple.
        It took some time after the release for it to attract attention, initially only reeling in loyal Apple fans but slowly started to intrigue more and more users, including people less dedicated to the brand.
        </p>
        <p class="productGridItem">
          <span class="subsubtitle">The problems the Apple Watch solves</span>
We all know about FitBits, they're not new to the market, and they work great for athletes, but that's the problem, it's intended to be used by athletes, not the average Joe.
          That's where the Apple Watch comes in, boasting most if not all features the FitBits have while also adding convenience and a wider appeal.
          Sure the Apple Watch is also intended for athletes quite a bit but they make up for that by having features not only athletes would need, such as sleep tracking, step tracking, integration with your (i)Phone which is not just through a single app, tracking your health (the newest model even including a sensor to check your temperature), support for third-party apps, and above all, having a completely working modern operating system on a device strapped onto your wrist!
        </p>
        <p class="productGridItem"> 
          <span class="subsubtitle">How does it work?</span>
        Well if you know how to use a phone, you'll have little problems with using WatchOS.
          Especially if you're used to iOS or any other operating system developed by Apple, pairing the watch is done through the Apple Watch App, after which it will save your device as its owner and connect to your Icloud account.
          After the watch has been paired to your device it will stay connected to it through bluetooth.
          The watch can be used through 2 different methods, through physical interaction with the watch itself and through something called Assistive Touch, this allows the watch to detect certain hand movements and do certain things when it detects these movements.

          <!-- made this part too long, still here for reviewers:
          
          Physical interaction has three input sources: the digital crown, the side-button and the touchscreen.
          The digital crown is used to scroll and modify certain settings like volume, this however can also be done through the touchscreen.
          The side-button has less features but is still a pretty important part of the device, being used for confirming Apple Pay payments, downloading apps, and allowing your Mac (if you have one of course) to autofill passwords without having to fill it in yourself.
          The touchscreen of course is pretty self-explanatory, touchscreen has been around long enough now for it to be understood universally. -->

        <p class="productGridItem">
          <span class="subsubtitle">Are there any celebrities endorsing the Apple Watch?</span>
        If we mean specifically endorsing then we already have an instant answer, this answer of course being Tim Cook, which is no surprise as he's the CEO of the massive company.
          However, if we're talking about celebrities who use the Apple Watch but don't necessarily feel the need to give a shout-out to Apple we've got quite a long list for you that will continue to grow as the gadget becomes more and more mainstream.
The celebrities we've spotted sporting their watch are the following: Oprah Winfrey, Kanye West, Katy Perry, Drake, Pharrell Williams, and Beyoncé, even sporting a solid gold version worth $16,000!
And this is still... far from the end of the list!
It's insane how fast the Apple Watch's popularity has skyrocketed in only the span of a few years, and don't just take our word for it, go out and see for yourself. Go sit at a popular spot somewhere and count how many you see, the results will shock you.
        </p>
        <p class="productGridItem">
          <span class="subsubtitle">What can we expect Apple to deliver?</span>
        Apple continues to pump out new versions of the watch to this day, slowly but surely polishing every aspect of the devices through software updates and new devices all together.
          You would probably think <span class="quote">"It's a watch, it can't possibly improve that much right?"</span>
          Well, I recently upgraded from the Series One to the Series Six, I had wanted to do so for quite a while but the one I had still worked, only when I noticed the screen bulging out due to battery swelling, was I sure that I had to get a new one, of course it was expensive, which we can expect from Apple but it was a step in the right direction.
          The series one was very barebones when compared to more recent models, a lot of features on it needed to be activated manually, such as workouts, but now, when I go to work and jump on my bicycle my watch doesn't hesitate to ask me to start a workout session to record.
        </p>
        <p class="productGridItem">
          <span class="subsubtitle">The future of the Apple Watch</span>
        The future of the Apple Watch looks far from bleak, with the most recent Apple Watch 8 and Apple Watch Ultra boasting features such as an amazing battery life, blabla, impressive water resistance (with the Ultra being able to go a max of 100 meters underwater), it looks like the line of Apple Watches is far from over as technology continues to evolve.
